KeepChat
========

This Xposed module lets you save any Snapchat. It works for snaps and stories, both images and videos, you either sent or receive via Snapchat. It has the possibility to save snaps in a different folder for each user.

This project was created by Sturmen and later maintained by stammler and than Ramis, huge credits to them! Ramis transferred the project to me and made me the new maintainer. I'm dedicated to improve Keepchat and give something back to the community.
